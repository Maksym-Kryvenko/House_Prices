# House Price Advanced Regression [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques]

## Project Overview:

Welcome to the House Price Advanced Regression Kaggle competition project! This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for my team's participation in the Kaggle competition titled "House Price Advanced Regression." The primary objective of this competition is to develop a robust regression model capable of accurately predicting house prices based on various features provided in the dataset. However, my main goals for this case are plotting technics and practice working with regression tasks.

## Competition Description:

The House Price Advanced Regression competition offers a challenging dataset with diverse features related to residential properties. Participants are challenged to construct a regression model that effectively predicts the sale prices of houses. The competition encourages exploration of advanced regression techniques, feature engineering, and model tuning to achieve the highest predictive accuracy.

## Repository Structure:

1. **Data:** Contains the dataset provided for the competition. Due to Kaggle's policies, we cannot include the dataset in this repository. However, instructions on how to download the data from the competition platform will be provided in the documentation.

2. **Notebooks:** Includes Jupyter notebooks for various stages of the project, such as data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. Note that all results, including visualizations and evaluation metrics, are stored within the notebooks for transparency and reproducibility.

3. **Scripts:** Holds any Python scripts developed for specific tasks, functions, or utilities used throughout the project.

4. **Models:** Stores the trained regression models or serialized versions that can be used for predictions without retraining.

5. **Documentation:** Contains detailed documentation explaining the project's goals, methodology, key decisions, and evaluation metrics. It also provides instructions on how to reproduce our results and run the code.

6. **Results:** Captures the output, visualizations, and any other results obtained during the development and evaluation of the models. In addition to the notebooks, this folder may include summary reports or aggregated results for easier access.
